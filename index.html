      <h2>My Personal Core Values</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Integrity</h3>
        <p>
         
          Integrity is one of my top priorities that i value and try to keep with everyone in my day to day life.
my family taught me to have integrity and to be honest and truthful.
           Integrity is important because it is needed to keep trust between the customer and the company. 
          Iif someone like a company doesnt have integrity and cant be honest with someone then people wont give you their trust.
           The ability to hold yourself and other people accountable for any mess ups or falter is also extremely important and can show growth.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Creativity</h3>
        <p>
          I strive to use my mind and use my creativity to solve any issues or problems that could come up
          I have always had a creative mind and developing it throughout life has helped me think out of the box.
          Its important to use creativity because an idea you might think is wild could help develop a idea that could be acheivable and help solve an issue.
          If you dont use creativity you cant be as helpful to solving issues that require fixing a problem the nontraditional way.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Responsibility</h3>
        <p>
          I will always take responsibility for any actions I do no matter the consequence.
          Growing up you are supposed to understand that responsibility is something that you will have to take wether good or bad.
          Responsibility is important to me because i know that if you cant take Responsibility you wont be trustworthy and reliable.
         If you were to not take responsibility, you could have even worse consequence or maybe wont get praised for having integrity and being honest.
         integrity and resposibility go hand in hand.

        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Respect</h3>
        <p>
         I believe that respect and the act of simply listening to someone is one of the most important parts of life that people dont usually talk about.
         Throughout my life respect was the main thing my father taught me to do for everyone.
         its important to Respect someone because if they respect you back makes it easier to connect with someone even if you have different opinions.
         if you dont show respect to someone, that could be a vital relationship you are losing just because you dont want to.
