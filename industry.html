        <h3>Film and Video Editing</h3>
        <p>
          The industry I am most interested in is the film industry.
          I have always been interested in film since i always watched movies and soon after youtube. I realized at a young age that I like putting the video together a little more than staring in it.
          It felt like putting a puzzle piece together but i had complete control of the shape of the puzzle.
          So being a video editor was one of the things that interested me the most.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Ethics in Storytelling</h3>
        <p>
         There are ethics in film that people need to worry about in film especially in video editing.
         As the editor you control the story and its your resposibility to tell it correctly with the right tone and timing.
         This is especially true for documentary since one clip taken out of context can completely ruin the documentary and destory the lives of people involved.
         Its up to the editor and the director to tell the story the best way possible while understanding how people including the audience could take the information presented to them.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3> Cybersecurity and Video editing</h3>
       <p>
          One of the things that need to be worried about is information leaking about a film or video that was originally supposed to be kept private. These types of information leaks could cause problems for the productions and marketing company.
          it may also be possible for hackers to get access to videos in the editing page and either leak them or destory some of the footage.
it is important for film and tv productions keep their productions and videos safe from things like data breaches to avoid this from happening.

        <h3>How Could Movie Makers Defend Against Cyber Attacks and Data Breaches?</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure only specific people have access to the cloud digitally.</li>
          <li>have backups of the backups on different files.</li>
          <li>Be skeptical of emails and links that look suspicious to avoid giving access.</li>
          <li>secure the physicial enviorment and make sure no one can physically get access to the cloud or on the set.</li>
